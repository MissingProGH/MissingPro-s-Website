    <h1>Welcome to the wonderful world of MissingPro!</h1>
    <h2>WHO IS THIS MAN?</h2>
    <p>Hi there! I'm MissingPro, and <b><i><u>you've stumbled upon my website!</u></i></b></p>
    <h3>WHAT DOES THIS MAN DO?</h3>
    <p>I play GD (Geometry Dash), Minecraft, Deadly Dash, SMM2 and, uh, yeah... that's really all I play. I just play 4 specially specified-by-me games!</p>
    <p>...</p>
    <p><b><i><u>BUT WAIT! THAT'S NOT ALL I PLAY!</u></i></b> I play lots of other games scoured on the Internet, such as Microsoft Edge Surf, Google Chrome Dino, <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/500921707/fullscreen/">Strange Platformer (by my friend!)</a>, stuff like <b><i><u>THAT.</u></i></b> I'm also into computers and technology in general. That's how I got online. Before then it was just staring at cringe Mario videos.</p>
    <h3>DOES THIS MAN WATCH TV?</h3>
    <p>The answer is... yes... but no. I watch TV rarely (I used to NEVER watch TV!) and most times, I'm just gonna then turn on my dad's Xbox One, switch the TV to HDMI1 and launch up Disney+ JUST TO WATCH... <b><i><u>THE SIMPSONS!!!!!1111!!!!!11!!
